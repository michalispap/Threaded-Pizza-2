# Threaded-Pizza-2

This is the second part of the "Threaded Pizza" project. What has changed is the "behaviour" of the cooks due to the fact that our pizza place finally has delivery drivers!  This means that certain parts of the code have been altered in order to adapt to the new environment. Now, ready pizzas wait for an available delivery driver to go pick them up, so new calculations with respect to delivery times have been added.
